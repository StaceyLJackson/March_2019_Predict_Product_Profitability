Predicting Product Profitability

PROJECT GOAL

A fictitous client has asked for historical sales data to be analysed so that sales volume can be predicted for a list of new product types. This analysis can then be used to help the sales team better understand how types of products might impact sales across the enterprise.

SUPPLIED DATA

CSV files of the historical data and the attributes of the potential new products.

TECHNICAL APPROACH

1. PRE-PROCESS THE DATA

Missing values check \n
Dummify variables \n
Outliers detected \n

2. ATTRIBUTE SELECTION

Correlation analysis \n
Decision Tree \n
Multiple regression to understand the statistical significance of individual variables \n
Normalising Variables \n

3. DATA PARTITION AND CROSS-VALIDATION 

4. MODELLING
Set up base models and assess them with different variables \n
Linear Model \n
SVM \n
KNN \n
Random Forest\n

5. PREDICTION AND ERROR ANALYSIS
